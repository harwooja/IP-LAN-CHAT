IP-LAN-CHAT
===========

Just a simple application using TCP/IP sockets. This code was written in high school so I took the old source file and fixed it up a tiny bit.

Simply put, two nodes connected to a LAN network can send messages back and forth by having the client enter the LAN IP
of the server. The client tries to create a connection with the server and the server is open to accept any incoming
connections.

Feel free to use the code, this was for educational purposes.
